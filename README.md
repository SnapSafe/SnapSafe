## What is this?

Imagine you have a photo album full of pictures from your child's birthday party. Your Great Aunt wants you to share the album with her. How do you do that? The default answer is to upload the album to social media and send it to her.

But now photos of your child exist on the public internet for anybody to see. In the age of AI, deep fakes, and internet creeps, this is something more and more people would like to avoid. Even if your album is private, you need to trust that the social media company is not using your photos to train its AI models or build a data profile on your family.

The same applies to photo storing services like Google Photos and iCloud. While they may assure you that your photos are stored securely, the reality is that these tech giants retain ownership of your data, giving them the freedom to do whatever they want with it.

But you still need to share that album! This is where SnapSafe comes in. Your photos are encrypted on your device before being uploaded. You then use asymmetric cryptography to securely share the decryption key with your Aunt so she can download and decrypt the photos on her device.
